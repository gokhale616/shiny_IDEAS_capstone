Parasites can have astonishing effects on their hosts. Just recently, over 200,000 saiga (antelope native to Central Asia) died course of a few days. [Researchers called these events](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/why-did-two-thirds-of-this-weird-antelope-suddenly-drop-dead/550676/?utm_source=twb) "unprecedented and unworldly". A bacterium, _Pasteurella multocida_, isolated from the blood of these animals was the cause. ![_Saiga tatarica_. Image from IUCN.](saiga-IUCN.jpg){height=250px}

Saiga, a species previously decimated by poaching, are endangered like  many other wild animals. Threatening factors like poaching and habitat make animals more vulnerable to parasites. On top of being threatened by other factors, mammals are more likely to be impacted by parasitism as well [IUCN](iucnredlist.org). Since the the number of endangered animals is on the rise, understanding patterns of parasitism is important for conservationists and wildlife managers. 

This dashboard is intended to be a resource for conservationists and undergraduate classrooms to visualize patterns of disease in threatened mammals.

## EXPLORE: 

* Which mammals are most vulnerable to parasites? 
* Which characteristics are associated with vulnerability to parasites? 

# Why are animals from some taxonomic families especially vulnerable to parasites? 

These interactive plots illustrate how mammals from some taxonomic families are more vulnerable to deadly parasites. In particular, carnivores in the Canidae, Otariidae, and Phocidae were likely to have deadly parasites. In ungulates, many families have a high proportion of threatened species overall but those in Bovidae were most likely to have deadly parasites. 

These families include all major groups of domesticated livestock (dogs, cats, goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs) showing the dangers of cross-species transmission that pets and livestock pose to  closely related wild species. 

Caption for host figure: The proportions of hosts that are threatened versus not threatened varies (_NonThreatened_) by host family and other grouping variables. Of the _threatened_ species, _ThreatOther_ shows the proportion threatened by a factor other than disease while ThreatDisease shows the proportion threatened by disease and other factors. Finally, some of the species were not threatened according to IUCN but still had diseases negatively affecting local populations (_Disease_). Data were collected from the IUCN species descriptions (for details see Pederson et al., Conservation Biology, 2007).

# Why are some parasites more threatening? 

TBD.
